# Movie Recommendation System
• Crafted a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering
techniques, leveraging the Surprise library for model builds

• Measured model performance utilizing performance measures such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to ensure accurate recommendations

• Deployed the model using AWS SageMaker, using its scalability for an efficient movie recommendation service
